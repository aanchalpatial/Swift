//1)*****COMPARING STRUCTURES & CLASSES*****
/*In C++ structures and classes are different by the fact that structures can only have properties whereas classes
can have both properties & methods.
BUT in swift structres as well as classes both can have properties & methods.
So what is the difference between them in swift???
There are 2 MAJOR differences between structures & classes in swift :-
->classes are REFERENCE TYPES, structures are VALUE TYPES
->classes allows inheritence whereas structure don't.
There are other minor differences which you can find on the link: https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/LanguageGuide/ClassesAndStructures.html
The additional capabilities that classes support come at the cost of increased complexity.
structures are PREFERED OVER classes when u both are eligible acc. to ur need
Use classes when you need to control the identity of the data you're modeling.
