/*Methods are functions that are associated with a particular type. 
The fact that structures and enumerations can define methods in Swift is a MAJOR DIFFERENCE from C and Objective-C.
In Objective-C, classes are the only types that can define methods. In Swift, you can choose whether
to define a class, structure, or enumeration, and still have the flexibility to define methods on the type you create.
