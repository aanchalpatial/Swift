/*Unlike the assignment operator in C and Objective-C, 
the assignment operator in Swift does not itself return a value,
to prevent it from being mistakenly used when the equal to operator (==) is intended*/

/*Unlike the arithmetic operators in C and Objective-C, 
the Swift arithmetic operators don’t allow values to overflow by default
You can opt in to value overflow behavior by using Swift’s overflow operators (such as a &+ b).*/

/*In a % b, the sign of b is ignored for negative values of b. 
This means that a % b and a % -b always give the same answer.*/
