//sometimes it s better to crash your app than running it in invalid state
//assertions , preconditions & fatalErrors
/*Assertions and preconditions are checks that happen at runtime. 
You use them to make sure an essential condition is satisfied before 
executing any further code. If the Boolean condition in the assertion or precondition 
evaluates to true, code execution continues as usual. If the condition evaluates to false, 
the current state of the program is invalid; code execution ends, and your app is terminated.
The DIFFERENCE between assertions and preconditions is in when they’re checked:
Assertions are checked only in debug builds, but preconditions are checked in both debug
and production builds.In production builds, the condition inside an assertion isn’t evaluated.
This means you can use as many assertions as you want during your development process,
without impacting performance in production. */
// all these messgae will be displayed in the debugger
let age = 2
assert(age >= 0,"age should be greater than zero")
//if assert condition is not satisfied than program execution stops
if(age > 0){}
else{
    assertionFailure("age should be greater than 0")
}
var index = 3
precondition(index > 0,"index has to be greater than   zero")
//preconditionFailure()
/*If you compile in unchecked mode (-Ounchecked), preconditions aren’t checked.
The compiler assumes that preconditions are always true, and it optimizes your code accordingly. 
However, the fatalError(_:file:line:) function always halts execution,
regardless of optimization settings.*/
//They are typically thrown when the application enters an unknown or unexpected state
if index < 0
{fatalError("index is invalid")}

/*Swift Optimisation Levels
To understand these assertions you need to understand optimisation levels. 
When you build your app the compiler will perform optimizations on your code
in order to make it run faster. You can have different optimisation level
s for different build configurations. These are the optimisation levels we’re interested in:
-Onone (default for debug builds)
-O (default for release builds)
-Ounchecked

assert(),assertionFailure()- The condition will only be evaluated for -Onone builds
precondition(),preconditionFailure() - works for -Onone and -O builds. In other words, for default debug
                                       and release configurations
fatalError()- It works for all optimisation levels in all build configurations */
