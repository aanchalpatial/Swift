/*Swift provides three primary collection types, known as arrays, sets, and dictionaries, for storing collections of values. 
Arrays are ordered collections of values.
Sets are unordered collections of unique values. 
Dictionaries are unordered collections of key-value associations.*/

//1)Arrays

//creating an empty array
var arr = [Int]()
//amother way of creating an empty array
//var arr = Array<Int>()
print(arr.count)
arr.append(7)
print(arr[0])
//Creating an Array with a Default Value
var arr2 = Array(repeating: 0.0,count: 5)
for i in arr2 {
    print(i,terminator: ", ")
}
//Creating an Array with an Array Literal
var shoppingList = ["Eggs", "Milk"]
/*Because all values in the array literal are of the same type, 
Swift can infer that [String] is the correct type to use for the shoppingList variable.*/
print()
print(shoppingList[1])
