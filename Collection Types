/*Swift provides three primary collection types, known as arrays, sets, and dictionaries, for storing collections of values. 
Arrays are ordered collections of values.
Sets are unordered collections of unique values. 
Dictionaries are unordered collections of key-value associations.*/



//1)Arrays

//creating an empty array
var arr = [Int]()
//amother way of creating an empty array
//var arr = Array<Int>()
print(arr.count)
arr.append(7)
print(arr[0])
//Creating an Array with a Default Value
var arr2 = Array(repeating: 0.0,count: 5)
for i in arr2 {
    print(i,terminator: ", ")
}
//Creating an Array with an Array Literal
var shoppingList = ["Eggs", "Milk"]
/*Because all values in the array literal are of the same type, 
Swift can infer that [String] is the correct type to use for the shoppingList variable.*/
print()
print(shoppingList[1])

//Acessing & Modifying an Array//Acessing & Modifying an Array
var arr3 = ["ap","anand","sachin","suvam"]
print(arr3.count)
if !arr3.isEmpty {
print("arr3 is not empty")}
arr3.append("roshan")
arr3 += ["ankit","akshay"]
for i in arr3 {print(i,terminator: " ")}
print()
arr3[4..<6] = ["abc","xyz"]
for i in arr3 {print(i,terminator: " ")}
print()
arr3.insert("roshan",at: 4)
for i in arr3 {print(i,terminator: " ")}
print()
arr3.remove(at: 5)
for i in arr3 {print(i,terminator: " ")}
print()
/*If you want to remove the final item from an array, use the removeLast() method
rather than the remove(at:) method to avoid the need to query the array’s count property. */
arr3.removeLast()
for i in arr3 {print(i,terminator: " ")}
print()

//Iterating over an array
/*If you need the integer index of each item as well as its value, 
use the enumerated() method to iterate over the array instead.*/
for (i,value) in arr3.enumerated() {print("\(i+1). \(value)")}




//2)Sets
/*A set stores distinct values of the same type in a collection with no defined ordering.
You can use a set instead of an array when the order of items is not important,
or when you need to ensure that an item only appears once.*/

/*A type must be hashable in order to be stored in a set—that is,
 the type must provide a way to compute a hash value for itself.
 All of Swift’s basic types (such as String, Int, Double, and Bool) are hashable by default */
 var numbers = Set<Int>()
 //sets do not have an equivalent shorthand form.
 //add an item in set
 numbers.insert(7)
 numbers.insert(10)
 numbers.insert(7)
 numbers.insert(4)
 numbers.insert(1)
 numbers.insert(11)
 print(numbers.count)
 //Creating a Set with an Array Literal
 var favoriteGenres: Set = ["Rock", "Classical", "Hip hop"]
 //remove an item
 numbers.remove(7)
 if !numbers.contains(7) { print("no. 7 is not present anymore in set")}
 
 /*Swift’s Set type does not have a defined ordering. To iterate over the values 
 of a set in a specific order, use the sorted() method*/
 for i in numbers {print(i,terminator: " ")}
 print()
 for i in numbers.sorted() {print(i,terminator: " ")}
 print()

 //performing set operations
 var set1: Set = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]
 var set2: Set = [0, 2, 4, 6, 8]
 var unionSet = set1.union(set2).sorted()
 for i in unionSet {print(i,terminator: " ")}
 print()
 var intersectionSet = set1.intersection(set2).sorted()
 var subSet = set1.subtracting(set2).sorted()
 var symDiffSet = set1.symmetricDifference(set2).sorted()

 //Set Membership and Equality
 var num:Set = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]
var evenNumbers: Set = [2,4,6,8,10]
var oddNumbers: Set = [1,3,5,7,9]
if evenNumbers != oddNumbers {print("they are different")}
if evenNumbers.isSubset(of: num) {print("yes")}
if num.isSuperset(of: oddNumbers) {print("yes")}
if evenNumbers.isDisjoint(with: oddNumbers) {print("yes")}
//isStrictSubset(of:) or isStrictSuperset(of:)  are there as well

 
 

//3)Dictionaries
//Note:tuples are not key-value pairs. tuples are group of different(more than 2) values represented as one.
/*A dictionary stores associations between keys of the same type and values of the same type
in a collection with no defined ordering. Each value is associated with a unique key, 
which acts as an identifier for that value within the dictionary. 
Unlike items in an array, items in a dictionary do not have a specified order.*/
//creating an empty Dictionary
// var playerNumbers = [String: Int]()
//another war to create an empty dictionary
//var playerNumbers = Dictionary<String, Int>()
//Creating a Dictionary with a Dictionary Literal
var playerNumbers = ["ronaldo": 7,"messi": 10,"saurez": 9]
print(playerNumbers.count)

//imp func. count,isEmpty
print("Jersey Number of CR7 is \(playerNumbers["ronaldo"]!)")
//update values in dictionary
playerNumbers["ronaldo"] = 09
print("Jersey Number of CR7 is \(playerNumbers["ronaldo"]!)")
//alternate method to update
/* the updateValue(_:forKey:) method sets a value for a key if none exists, 
or updates the value if that key already exists.
HOWEVER, the updateValue(_:forKey:) method returns the old value after performing an update.*/
if let old = playerNumbers.updateValue(07, forKey: "ronaldo") {
    print("old jersey number of ronaldo was \(old)")
}
print("Jersey Number of CR7 now is \(playerNumbers["ronaldo"]!)")

//remove a key-value pair
playerNumbers["saurez"] = nil
print(playerNumbers.count)

//iterating over dictionar
for (name,number) in playerNumbers {
    print("\(name) has jersey number \(number)")
}
for name in playerNumbers.keys {
    print(name,terminator: " ")
}
print()
for number in playerNumbers.values {
    print(number,terminator: " ")
}
